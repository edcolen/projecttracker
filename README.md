# Project Tracker (in progress)

This project is a piece for portfolio, so my code and logic can be seen by whoever might be interested. The idea is to create an app to manage projects and track bugs, being useful enough for both planning and maintenance phases.

The idea behind building a bug tracker as a project was because it would require (and show) the following skills:

- Follow a design pattern
- Have a professional UI (clean and responsive)
- Use a database (with CRUD functions)
- Use authentication and authorization (regarding security)
- Solves a business problem (is useful)
- Is recognizable by people who see it

I also plan on using it as I build other projects, improving features along the way.

Besides feeding my portfolio, my main goal is to keep learning new technologies and concepts. For each project I'll set some requirements based on what I want to build and what I want to learn. This will dictate the features to be implemented and the technical choices. So, even if another path would be more adequate, I'd stick to what I'd like to learn at the moment.

## Constraints and Assumptions (things to be learned, deepened or showcased)

In order to fulfill my goals, this project needs to:

- Have Software Requirement Specifications
- Have a back-end built with Ruby on Rails
- Use MVC (and another suitable design pattern)
- Use tests (TDD)
- Be hosted in Heroku
- Use Docker
- Use PostgreSQL
- Use ActionCable for notifications
- Use Resque for background jobs
- Use Redis (as required by Heroku, ActionCable and Resque)
- Have responsive design
- Use Mobylette gem for mobile experience
- Ability to sign up/login with OmniAuth
- E-mail integration to send invitations to collaborate
- Collapsible items list to save display space
- Have demo accounts with different privileges and data sample
- Draggable cards in Kanban view

## Functional Requirements (features to be implemented)

As acceptance criteria, the first version of the app must fulfill all requirements above and the following:
